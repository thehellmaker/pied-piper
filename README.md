# Pied Piper
`PiedPier` is an open source, realtime graph creation/execution or in simple terms aggregation engine which along with https://github.com/thehellmaker/pied-piper-ui will let any user build a backend API without any coding knowledge for most common usecases. 

## Haven't you ever been sick of coding?

- Have you ever been sick of writing **lots of code** just to make a HTTP call?
- Have you ever been sick of **writing unit tests and integration tests** for all the code you just wrote to make this simple HTTP call?
- Have you been sick of now setting up a **CI pipeline** to ensure everything is tested before the it goes to prod?
- Have you ever been sick of now figuring out **where to host your API** and doing all the setup to get your API running?
